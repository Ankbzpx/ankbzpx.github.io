# Neural Implicit Octahedral Field (WIP)

Ever since the badge generation project, I have been fascinated by the process of 3D mesh modeling--the artistry of editing via duplicating and offseting polygon edge loops and faces. Its effectiveness and enabled concise control are hard to replicate for other geometry representation apart from mesh. Moreover, its prefers quad domaint mesh of clean and feature aligned edge loops--the property that meshes extracted from state of the art 3D generative models do not possess.

The obvious means to bridge this gap is to extract mesh first (i.e. using Marching cube and its derivatives), then apply quadrilateral remeshing, and the most accessible implementation is provided by [Instant meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes) (IM).

This is also where I started. After the whole week of scrutinizing IM implementation, I was amazed by how elegant it is--the feature aligned quad tessellation guiding field, known as 2D cross field, can be effortlessly generated by local smoothing in 3D ambient space. Its locally smooth and only locally property immediately strikes me a potential neural implicit extension. However, the cross field is defined on 2-manifold, as opposed to euclidean space of MLP neuron, and measuring their smoothness requires exhaustive matching between representation vectors.

Fortunately, the 3D generalization of cross field, the octahedral field, paves both obstacles. The field itself is well defined in euclidean ambient space, while its smoothness can also be measured matching-free in the same space, by leveraging the its Spherical Harmonics (SH) parameterized functional representation. By enforing the normal alignment on surface points, and encourage locally smoothness in parameterization space anywhere else, I am able to learn an implcit octahedral field, that when visualized on extracted surface, produces similar flowlines as analytically solved using global system. During experiment, I also find that such field provides a natural guidance for enforing sharp feature of neural implicit geometry when training jointly, thanks to its octahedral symmetry.
