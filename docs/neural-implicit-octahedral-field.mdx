# Neural Implicit Octahedral Field (WIP)

Ever since the badge generation project, I have been fascinated by the process of 3D mesh modeling--the artistry of duplicating and offsetting mesh edge loops. Its enabled concise and meticulous control are hard to replicate for other geometry representation, i.e. the implicit one preferred by state of the art 3D generative methods. Aggravatingly, such editing requires quad dominant mesh of feature aligned edge loops--the property that mesh extracted from volume data does not possess.

To bridge the gap, the obvious choice is to extract mesh first (i.e. using Marching cube and its derivatives), then apply quadrilateral remeshing. This is also where I started. After the whole week of scrutinizing [Instant meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes) (IM), the most accessible open implementation, I was amazed by how elegant it is--the feature aligned quad tessellation guiding field, known as 2D cross field, can be effortlessly generated by local smoothing in 3D ambient space. Its smooth only and local only property immediately strikes me as a prefect candidate neural implicit representation. However, the cross field is defined on 2-manifold, as opposed to euclidean space of MLP neuron, and measuring their smoothness requires exhaustive matching between representation vectors, which is hard to implement implicitly.

Fortunately, the 3D generalization of cross field, the octahedral field, paves both obstacles. The field itself is well defined in euclidean ambient space, while its smoothness can also be measured in the same space with a matching-free manner, by leveraging its Spherical Harmonics (SH) parameterized functional representation. Moreover, smooth octahedral field in SH parameterization space preserves the feature aligned property.

To this end, I use a coordinate-base MLP to predict the SH parameterization of octahedral field, by supervising normal alignment with surface samples, while regularizing it to be locally as smooth as possible in the ambient space. It successfully encodes volume octahedral field implicitly, that when evaluated on surface, gives similar flowlines as the ones solved using global system, as shown below:

When training jointly with neural SDF field, it also serves a natural guidance for enforcing sharp feature of implicit geometry, thanks to its octahedral symmetry $\pi= f(x)$.

One intriguing property of the implicit octahedral field, is the fact that it is fully defined in the ambient space.
