# Neural Implicit Octahedral Field (WIP)

Ever since the badge generation project, I have been fascinated by the process of 3D mesh modeling--the artistry of duplicating and offsetting mesh edge loops. Its enabled concise and meticulous control are hard to replicate for other geometry representation, i.e. the implicit one preferred by state of the art 3D generative methods. Aggravatingly, such editing requires quad dominant mesh of feature aligned edge loops--the property that mesh extracted from volume data does not possess.

To bridge the gap, the obvious choice is to extract mesh first (i.e. using Marching Cube (MC) and its derivatives), then apply quadrilateral remeshing. This is also where I started. After the whole week of scrutinizing the source code of [Instant meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes), one of the most accessible implementation in public, I was amazed by how elegant it is--The 2D cross field utilized to guide quad tessellation, it computed with pure local smoothing (in fact it is also randomly initialized), while being smooth enough in 3D ambient space, it automatically aligns with sharp features. 

The local smooth only property immediately strikes me as a prefect candidate for neural implicit representation. However, the cross field is defined on 2-manifold, as opposed to euclidean space the most MLP output lies. Also, measuring their pairwise smoothness requires exhaustive matching between representation vectors, which is hard to integrate implicitly.

Fortunately, the 3D generalization of cross field, the octahedral field, paves both obstacles. Being 3D, the octahedral field is naturally defined in euclidean ambient space, in which its smoothness can be measured matching-free, by leveraging its Spherical Harmonics (SH) parameterized functional representation. Most prominently, smooth octahedral field in SH parameterization space inherents the same feature aligned property from its 2D counterpart.

To this end, I use a coordinate-base MLP to predict the SH parameterization of octahedral field, by supervising normal alignment with surface samples, while regularizing it to be locally as smooth as possible in the ambient space. It successfully encodes volume octahedral field implicitly, that when evaluated on surface, gives similar flowlines as the ones solved using global system, as shown below:

When training jointly with neural SDF field, it also serves a natural guidance for enforcing sharp feature of implicit geometry, thanks to its octahedral symmetry $\pi= f(x)$

One intriguing property of the implicit octahedral field, is the fact that it is fully defined in the ambient space.
