# Neural Implicit Octahedral Field (WIP)

<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">
    <strong>WARNING</strong> This project is still working in progress (WIP) and results presented here are subject to change

## Motivation

Ever since the badge generation project, I have been fascinated by quad mesh modeling. The edge-loop centered operations enable concise and fine-grained control, which are hard to replicate with other geometry representations (i.e. the implicit one). 

To bridge the gap, I started with the common practice of extracting mesh first and then applying quadrilateral remeshing. After scrutinizing the source code of [Instant meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes), I was captivated by its guiding cross field, which automatically snap to sharp features under sufficient smoothness in 3D ambient space. Though it is only defined in 2-manifold and measuring its smoothness requires pairwise matching, the local smoothing alone immediately strikes me as a possible lead for neural implicit representation. Following this path, I later came across its 3D generalization, the octahedral field, that ticks all the boxes:
- [x] Well defined in Euclidean space
- [x] Matching-free smoothing<sup>*</sup>
- [x] Snaps to sharp features under sufficient smoothness<sup>*</sup>

making it the perfect candidate for implicit integration

## Overview
Given a uniformly sampled oriented point cloud, we leverage MLPs to jointly fit the implicit SDF and the octahedral field.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{MLP}_{\text{sdf}}: & \ \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \\
\text{MLP}_{\text{oct}}: & \ \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^9
\end{aligned}
$$

To fit SDF, we use [Siren](https://github.com/vsitzmann/siren) and follow its [common practice](https://github.co
m/vsitzmann/siren/blob/4df34baee3f0f9c8f351630992c1fe1f69114b5f/loss_functions.py#L214). The octahedral field, on the other hand, is supervised to match the orientation of point samples, while elsewhere regularized to be locally as smooth as possible. To encourage smoothness, instead of minimizing gradient norm, we directly leverages [LipMLP](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/lip-mlp/), that speeds up training by 50%. Please refer to the publication and the code release for more details.

## Key results
### Direct cross field evaluation
When evaluated on the extracted surface, our implicit octahedral field gives flowlines similar to ones solved globally on the manifold, saving the cost of the corresponding step in quadrilateral remeshing.

### Octahedral prior for surface regularization
Moreover, in-between supervised samples, the normal aligned octahedral frame converges to either $\pi / 2$ or $\pi$ at infinitesimal, introducing additional sharp features prior for SDF.

Specifically, we regularize the gradient of SDF to match any one axis of the octahedral frame. Here is a toy example to demonstrate the idea

The regularization shines the most for geometry of sharp features. In the following example, we surpass the baseline with a cleaner and sharper reconstruction, only using $1/4$ of the input samples.

### Neural inverse volume parameterization
The octahedral field originated in guiding the volume parameterization for the hexahedral mesh generation. As hinted in [CubeCover](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-geom/publications/db/2011_Nieser-Reitebuch-Polthier_CubeCover.pdf), the hexahedral tessellation of the 3D volume is equivalent to a regular cube tessellation in its parameterization space. Given we fit the implicit octahedral field to align with the zero level set, applying MC in the volume parameterization space should cut the cubes in parallel along their faces, resulting in quad dominant mesh in original space.

In this case, we are interested in CubeCover without integer grid constrains, or namely, the continuous seamless parameterization.

$$
\int_{V} \| \nabla f- X \|_F^2 \ d{V}
$$
where $f: V \in \mathbb{R}^3 \to V_{param}$

But before continue, it is crucial to firstly examine the singularity graph. We follow CubeCover to visualize it as the edges of the bounding tetrahedral mesh.

<SingularityViewer />

Our implicit octahedral field gives reasonable singularity graph, but some of which are intricate and noisy that may need post-processing. Upon further consideration, even if we successfully cut the singularities and compute inversion-free parameterization, it is still difficult to sample a voxel of coordinates in parameterization space and wrap them back to $\mathbb{R}^3$ to query SDF.

Therefore, we take a step back by relaxing the problem to the singularity-free case, and tackle the parameterization inversely using a neural field.
$$
\int_{V_{param}} \| (\nabla f^{-1})^T - X \circ f^{-1} \|_F^2 \ d{V_{param}}
$$
where $f^{-1}: V_{param} \to V \in \mathbb{R}^3$

Specifically, we model the inverse parameterization function $f^{-1}$ as a vector potential, and supervise the transpose of its gradient to match the octahedral frame, under additional regularization of orthogonality. The energy can then be minimized efficiently using SH parameterization.

Here is an example of singularity-free inverse parameterization for a singularity-free octahedral field.

<InverseParamViewer name='cube_twist' position={[-1.5, 1.125, -0.75]} />

Here is an example of the one for an octahedral field with singularities. The input model was deliberately rotated so that its sharp edges mismatch the coordinate axis. The inverse parameterization roughly fits a tight-oriented bounding box, such that applying MC in its parameterization space gives cleaner and sharper edges. The difference is exceptionally noticeable when the voxel resolution is low.

<InverseParamViewer name='fandisk_rot' position={[-1.25, 0.9375, -0.625]} target={[0, 0.05, -0.1]} />

Unfortunately, the extraction quality is limited. To best of our understanding:
1. The global least square conformal parameterization inevitably introduces distortion, so the zero level set is not perfectly aligned with the grid faces.
2. The SDF, octahedral field, and inverse parameterization function are all modelled using MLP, each with varying model capacity, making aligning them at zero level set challenging and error-prone.
3. When points sampled at a distance from the supervised points, the SH coefficients may deviate significantly from the octahedral variety, such that rotations recovered by minimizing the $l_2$ norm are no longer accurate. This is especially the case because we sample points directly in a parameterization space, with no prior knowledge of how they would land in original space.
4. The inverse parameterization function is modeled by a general vector potential using MLP. It is highly unconstrained, such that forcing it to have orthogonal gradient is already difficult, not to mention the additional requirement to match a (possibly singular) octahedral frame.

However, we believe it would be an interesting direction for future research.

#### Bonus
My initial plan was to tackle the volume parameterization with singularity on a tetrahedral mesh, but later realized the problem is much more involved than anticipated (singularity curve is difficult to cut, the parameterization has overlaps, etc.). Nevertheless, it was a fun experience, so I record my attempt here.
